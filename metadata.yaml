description: "Seven Little Australians (1894) is a classic Australian children's novel\
  \ by Ethel Turner. Set mainly in Sydney in the 1880s, it relates the adventures\
  \ of the seven mischievous Woolcot children, their stern army father Captain Woolcot,\
  \ and flighty stepmother Esther.\nTurner wrote the novel in 1893 whilst living at\
  \ Inglewood in what was then rural Lindfield, (now Woodlands, Killara), having moved\
  \ there from the city suburb of Paddington in 1891. The suburban bushland surroundings\
  \ quickly became important in Turner's stories. On her 21st birthday, Ethel wrote\
  \ in her diary, 'Seven L. Aust. â€“ sketched it out.' (24 January 1893)\nIn 1994 the\
  \ novel was the only book by an Australian author to have been continuously in print\
  \ for 100 years.\nThe book's original handwritten manuscript is held by the State\
  \ Library of NSW. The full text of the manuscript has been digitized and can be\
  \ viewed on the Library's website. The original title of the novel, as written by\
  \ Turner, was 'Seven Pickles'.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
